# nvim

A personal collection of configuration files for [Neovim](https://neovim.io/). It uses the
[vim-plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug) plugin manager and includes plugins for
language support, git integration, file browsing and a custom user interface.

## Old configuration

This was my very first Neovim setup when I started exploring the editor. I have since moved
on to a different configuration and **no longer use this one**. Feel free to browse the files
or use them as a starting point for your own setup.

## Archived

This repository is kept for historical reference and is now archived. No further development

## Installation instructions

1. Clone this repository into `~/.config`.
2. Run `nvim`.
3. Run `:PlugInstall` inside Neovim to install plugins.

To manage this configuration alongside other dotfiles, consider using a tool like
[GNU Stow](https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/).
